Modular Programming: The Irish Setter Example
=============================================

This project contains the source code for the “Implementing FP Behavior with Modules”
lesson in my book, [Learning Functional Programming in Scala](https://gumroad.com/l/lfpis).

The source code is contained in the file, *IrishSetter.scala*, and is intended
to be used in the Scala REPL.
